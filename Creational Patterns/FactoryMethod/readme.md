In Go, due to the absence of traditional OOP features like classes and inheritance, we typically use a simplified version of the Factory Method pattern known as the "Simple Factory" pattern.

## In this example:

We define a Product interface that represents the products created by the factory.

We create two concrete product types, ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB, which implement the Product interface.

We define a Factory interface responsible for creating products.

We implement two concrete factories, ConcreteFactoryA and ConcreteFactoryB, each of which creates a specific product type.

In the main function, we demonstrate how to use these factories to create products. factory, which creates guns of the desired type based on an incoming argument. The main.go acts as a client. Instead of directly interacting with ak47 or musket, it relies on gunFactory to create instances of various guns, only using string parameters to control the production.
